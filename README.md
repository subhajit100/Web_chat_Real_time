# Web_chat_Real_time
#### This is a Real Time Chat Application which can handle multiple users at one time. I have used HTML, CSS and JS for front end, NodeJs for backend and socket.io for bidirectional communication between server and client.
#### As I am from India , so tried to give a shade of our Indian flag at the background. 
#### The application is running on render.com . You can have a look at it [here](https://i-web-chat-app.onrender.com/)
